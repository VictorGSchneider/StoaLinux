# DFM - Dotfile Manager

A GTK4/Adwaita GUI application for managing dotfiles on Linux.

**DFM does not move or centralize your dotfiles.** Each config file stays in its original location (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`, etc.). DFM detects them, lets you edit in place through a friendly GUI, and creates automatic backups before any change.

## Features

### In-Place Editing

DFM edits your dotfiles where they live — no symlinking, no moving files into a bare git repo. When you change a value in the GUI, DFM writes directly to the original file. A versioned backup is created automatically before every write, so you can always roll back.

### Smart Config Parsing

Automatically scans your system for known dotfiles and config directories (`~/.config/*`), analyzes each file, and generates the appropriate UI controls:

- Toggle switches for boolean values (`true`/`false`, `yes`/`no`, `on`/`off`)
- Sliders for numeric values (opacity, gaps, borders, etc.)
- Color pickers for hex color values
- Text fields for strings
- Path selectors with file browser for file paths
- Spin buttons for numeric values
- Font fields
- Keybind display for keyboard shortcuts
- Section headers parsed from comments

Formats handled: INI, TOML, YAML, JSON, Lua, shell, X Resources, i3/Hyprland
`.conf`, plus a generic `key = value` fallback.

### Lua Configs

Apps that configure themselves in Lua — Hyprland (`hyprland.lua`), Neovim
(`init.lua`), WezTerm (`wezterm.lua`), AwesomeWM (`rc.lua`), xplr — are parsed
as first-class configs instead of falling back to generic text:

- Nested tables become sections, so `decoration.blur.enabled` shows up as a
  toggle under its own group
- Booleans, numbers, strings, colors and paths get the same smart widgets as
  every other format
- List entries (`exec-once = { "waybar" }`, Hyprland `bind` tables) are
  editable item by item
- Writes preserve the original formatting: quoting style, trailing commas,
  inline `--` comments and indentation stay exactly as they were
- Function bodies, `require()` calls and other executable code are left alone
  rather than being offered as editable values
- Syntax checking uses `luac` when the `lua` package is installed, and falls
  back to structural checks (unbalanced braces, `end` mismatch, unterminated
  strings) when it isn't
- `require("config.foo")` pointing at a module that does not exist in your
  config tree is reported by the Analyzer

When a directory holds both the legacy and the Lua config (e.g. `hyprland.conf`
and `hyprland.lua`), DFM opens the Lua one.

### Raw Text Viewer

Built-in viewer for inspecting dotfiles without leaving the app:

- Syntax highlighting (comments, keys, values, colors, booleans; Lua keywords and `--` comments in Lua files)
- Copy to clipboard
- Line wrap toggle
- Reload button
- File stats (line count, file size)

### Backup & Versioning

- Automatic backup before every edit
- Versioned history stored in `~/.local/share/dfm/backups/`
- Restore any previous version from the UI

### Profiles & Templates

- Save and switch between configuration profiles (e.g. "desktop", "laptop", "minimal")
- Built-in templates for common setups
- Configuration wizard for quick initial setup

### Analyzer & Debugger

A dedicated diagnostics page that scans all your dotfiles at once and reports issues grouped by severity (errors, warnings, info). Accessible from the sidebar or the Tools menu.

**Per-file checks:**
- Syntax validation for known formats (JSON, TOML, YAML, INI, Lua, shell, Xresources)
- Broken symlinks and missing referenced files (`source ~/.zsh_custom` pointing to nothing)
- Duplicate keys that silently shadow earlier values
- Empty values that may be unintentional
- Insecure permissions on sensitive files (world-readable `.netrc`, etc.)
- Deprecated or problematic patterns (double PATH append, eval ssh-agent)
- Missing required and optional package dependencies (checked against the
  system's own package manager — pacman, apt, dnf, zypper, apk, xbps or Portage)

**Cross-file conflict detection:**
- Environment variables set to different values across shells (e.g. `EDITOR` in `.bashrc` vs `.zshrc`)
- Aliases defined differently in multiple shell configs
- Multiple window managers enabled simultaneously (i3 + Hyprland)
- Multiple notification daemons active (Dunst + Mako)
- Multiple status bars enabled (Waybar + Polybar)

**UI features:**
- Summary cards showing total files scanned, errors, warnings, and healthy count
- Color-coded severity badges (terracotta for errors, gold for warnings, azure for info)
- Fix hints with one-click copy, in the local package manager's syntax
  (`sudo pacman -S hyprland` on Arch, `sudo apt install hyprland` on Debian)
- Navigate directly from an issue to the dotfile's config page

### File Change Monitoring

- Real-time detection of external edits to tracked dotfiles
- Toast notifications with one-click reload

### GitHub Sync

Sync your dotfiles with GitHub using the community-standard dedicated repo approach (`~/.dotfiles`). **This is the only feature that copies files** — it copies enabled dotfiles into `~/.dotfiles` for pushing to GitHub, but your originals stay in place.

- **Push**: copies enabled dotfiles into the repo, commits, and pushes
- **Pull**: pulls from GitHub and installs to home (existing files are backed up)
- **Create Repo**: creates a new private `dotfiles` repo on GitHub and clones it locally
- **Clone Repo**: clones your existing dotfiles repo from GitHub
- **Share as Gist**: upload an individual dotfile as a GitHub Gist (secret or public) for quick sharing

All GitHub features use the `gh` CLI for authentication, so no tokens are stored by DFM.

### Import / Export

Export your dotfiles as a `.tar.gz` archive with a manifest and import them on another machine. Existing files are backed up before overwriting.

### Stoa-Themed UI

- Classical dark theme inspired by [Stoa Linux](https://github.com/VictorGSchneider/StoaLinux) — marble, bronze, parchment, and stone tones
- Sidebar navigation listing all detected dotfiles with icons and categories
- Right panel with configuration fields grouped by section
- **All Dotfiles** overview page with toggle switches, grouped by category
- **Analyzer & Debugger** page for unified diagnostics
- GitHub Sync status and controls integrated into the overview page

## Supported Dotfiles

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10+
- GTK 4
- libadwaita
- PyGObject
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) — optional, required for GitHub sync features
- `lua` — optional, enables full syntax checking of Lua configs via `luac`

### Installing the system dependencies

DFM runs on any distro with GTK4 and libadwaita. Package names differ, so
pick the line for your system:

```bash
# Arch / Manjaro / EndeavourOS
sudo pacman -S python python-gobject gtk4 libadwaita

# Debian / Ubuntu / Mint
sudo apt install python3 python3-gi gir1.2-gtk-4.0 gir1.2-adw-1

# Fedora / RHEL / Rocky
sudo dnf install python3 python3-gobject gtk4 libadwaita

# openSUSE
sudo zypper install python3 python3-gobject gtk4 libadwaita

# Alpine
sudo apk add python3 py3-gobject3 gtk4.0 libadwaita

# Void
sudo xbps-install -S python3 python3-gobject gtk4 libadwaita
```

Optional extras, whatever the distro:

- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) for the sync features — then `gh auth login`
- **Lua** for full syntax checking of Lua configs via `luac`; without it DFM
  falls back to a structural check

DFM detects your package manager at runtime, so the Analyzer's dependency
checks and its one-click fix hints come out in your system's own syntax. On a
distro it doesn't recognise it still runs — it just stops offering install
commands it can't be sure of.

## Usage

```bash
# Run directly from a clone
python -m dfm.main

# Install with pipx (recommended on Arch / PEP 668 systems)
pipx install --editable .
dfm

# Or install into a venv / --user site
pip install -e .
dfm
```

An XDG desktop entry is shipped at `data/dfm.desktop` — symlink or copy it
into `~/.local/share/applications/` to get a launcher icon in rofi drun,
GNOME Activities, or any app grid.

### StoaLinux

[StoaLinux](https://github.com/VictorGSchneider/StoaLinux) ships DFM
pre-wired: `install.sh` installs the in-tree fork at `scripts/stoa-dfm/`
as an editable pipx (or venv) package, links the desktop entry, and binds
`Super+G` to launch it. No extra setup needed.

## How It Works

1. **Scan** — DFM scans `~/` and `~/.config/` for known dotfiles
2. **Parse** — Each file is analyzed to infer field types (booleans, numbers, colors, paths, etc.)
3. **Display** — A GUI is generated with appropriate widgets for each field
4. **Analyze** — The Analyzer checks syntax, references, duplicates, dependencies, permissions, and cross-file conflicts
5. **Edit** — Changes are written directly to the original file (backup created first)
6. **Sync** (optional) — Copies to `~/.dotfiles` for GitHub push/pull

Your dotfiles never leave home.
